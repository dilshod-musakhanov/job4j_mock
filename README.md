##CheckDev is a platform for conducting practice interviews.

To summarize:

A programmer selects the relevant section, for example, Java. Then, they choose a topic of interest, such as collections.

Next, they create an interview. Interviews can be of two types: they ask questions or they answer questions.

Other participants can respond to this interview in the role opposite to the one chosen by the interview author.

The interview author then selects one of the interested participants and conducts a personal conversation with them.

Afterward, both the author and the participant provide feedback on each other's knowledge of the selected topic.

The feedback will be two-way, meaning that each of the interview participants can adjust their knowledge.
